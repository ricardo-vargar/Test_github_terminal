# Othello Game Plan (Pygame Implementation)

## Overview

- Build a graphical Othello (Reversi) game using Pygame.
- Player vs Bot (AI) mode.
- Mouse click support for placing pieces.
- Visual feedback for valid moves and game state.

---

## Sections

### 1. Game Setup

- Initialize Pygame window (e.g., 600x600 pixels).
- Draw an 8x8 grid for the Othello board.
- Set up initial board state (4 pieces in the center).

### 2. Game Logic

- Represent board as a 2D array (8x8).
- Implement rules for valid moves and piece flipping.
- Alternate turns between player and bot.
- Detect game end and count pieces.

### 3. User Interaction

- Allow player to select moves by clicking on valid squares.
- Highlight valid moves for the player.
- Display current scores and turn.

### 4. Bot (AI) Implementation

- Bot chooses moves using a simple heuristic (e.g., maximize flips, prefer corners).
- Bot plays automatically after playerâ€™s turn.

### 5. Graphics & Feedback

- Draw pieces (black/white) on the board.
- Highlight valid moves and last move.
- Show winner and scores at game end.

### 6. Structure

- Main game loop handles events, updates, and rendering.
- Separate classes/functions for board logic, rendering, and bot AI.

## File Structure

- `othello_pygame.py`: Main game file with all logic and Pygame code.

## Next Steps

- Review this plan.
- Approve or suggest changes.
- Upon approval, I will generate the code in a new file.
